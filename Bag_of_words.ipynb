CKs were cycled.  The patient was held NPO and\\nfamily members were [**Name (NI) 653**].  The patient was continued on\\nLevofloxacin as started at the outside hospital and given\\ninhalers p.r.n.\\n\\nA psychiatry consultation was obtained on the morning of\\n[**2200-4-7**], given the patient's significant degree of\\ndisorientation and confusion and labile emotions.  The\\npsychiatrist's impression was that the patient was suffering\\nfrom delirium with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status\\nexamination with poor memory.  At the time of the interview,\\nthe patient was agreeing to consider catheterization although\\nit was noted that if she changed her mind given the\\nimportance of this procedure that her husband and children\\nshould be [**Doctor Last Name 653**] regarding consent for the procedure and\\nthat her capacity to consent at that time should be held in\\nquestion.  Recommendations were made for Haldol p.r.n. as\\nwell as Xanax.  B12, folate, RPR and TSH were all ordered\\nwhich returned as normal.  The patient also had a head CT at\\nthe outside hospital which was unremarkable.\\n\\nCKs were sent at our hospital with initial level of CPK 464,\\nMB 12 and a troponin of 49 obtained.  The patient had been\\nplaced on Heparin prior to the anticipation of cardiac\\ncatheterization. The patient was initially consented to have\\ncardiac catheterization on [**2200-4-7**], although had an acute\\ndecompensation in mental status and anxiety attack and it was\\ndetermined that she would be at high risk for the procedure\\nat that time.  Thus, the procedure was deferred to the\\nmorning of [**2200-4-8**], and findings were as follows:\\n\\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction 62%.  Inferior\\nhypokinesis.  Normal valves.  Discrete proximal right\\ncoronary artery lesion of 100% stenosis.  Left main 100%\\ndiscrete stenosis.  Mid left anterior descending discrete\\n100% stenosis, 50% discrete midcircumflex stenosis.  Bypass\\ngraft saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was\\n100% discrete stenosis.  Left internal mammary artery to the\\nleft anterior descending patent and RIMA to the right\\ncoronary artery with a 40% stenosis.  No intervention was\\nperformed.\\n\\nIt was determined that the patient should be maximized on\\nmedical therapy only.  The patient was prescribed with\\nAspirin and Plavix at that time and given diuresis for\\nincreasing oxygen requirement.  The patient returned to the\\nfloor in stable condition and was to the Step-Down Cardiac\\nUnit on [**2200-4-8**].

oxygen sats in the 90s subsequent to this he was transfered to the icu after spiking a fever and with radiographic evidence of bilateral aspiration pneumonia his antibiotics were expanded to vanc cipro flagyl in the icu , he remained non compliant with therapies , required restraint , and refused hemodialysis he was sent back to the floor the following day ( 5 29 ) as his oxygenation improved ( 90 's on two litres nasal cannula , which he would not keep on , thus requiring restraint ) olanzapine was started for agitation his mental status improved gradually , and by discharge he was no

CKs were cycled.  The patient was held NPO and\\nfamily members were [**Name (NI) 653**].  The patient was continued on\\nLevofloxacin as started at the outside hospital and given\\ninhalers p.r.n.\\n\\nA psychiatry consultation was obtained on the morning of\\n[**2200-4-7**], given the patient's significant degree of\\ndisorientation and confusion and labile emotions.  The\\npsychiatrist's impression was that the patient was suffering\\nfrom delirium with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status\\nexamination with poor memory.  At the time of the interview,\\nthe patient was agreeing to consider catheterization although\\nit was noted that if she changed her mind given the\\nimportance of this procedure that her husband and children\\nshould be [**Doctor Last Name 653**] regarding consent for the procedure and\\nthat her capacity to consent at that time should be held in\\nquestion.  Recommendations were made for Haldol p.r.n. as\\nwell as Xanax.  B12, folate, RPR and TSH were all ordered\\nwhich returned as normal.  The patient also had a head CT at\\nthe outside hospital which was unremarkable.\\n\\nCKs were sent at our hospital with initial level of CPK 464,\\nMB 12 and a troponin of 49 obtained.  The patient had been\\nplaced on Heparin prior to the anticipation of cardiac\\ncatheterization. The patient was initially consented to have\\ncardiac catheterization on [**2200-4-7**], although had an acute\\ndecompensation in mental status and anxiety attack and it was\\ndetermined that she would be at high risk for the procedure\\nat that time.  Thus, the procedure was deferred to the\\nmorning of [**2200-4-8**], and findings were as follows:\\n\\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction 62%.  Inferior\\nhypokinesis.  Normal valves.  Discrete proximal right\\ncoronary artery lesion of 100% stenosis.  Left main 100%\\ndiscrete stenosis.  Mid left anterior descending discrete\\n100% stenosis, 50% discrete midcircumflex stenosis.  Bypass\\ngraft saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was\\n100% discrete stenosis.  Left internal mammary artery to the\\nleft anterior descending patent and RIMA to the right\\ncoronary artery with a 40% stenosis.  No intervention was\\nperformed.\\n\\nIt was determined that the patient should be maximized on\\nmedical therapy only.  The patient was prescribed with\\nAspirin and Plavix at that time and given diuresis for\\nincreasing oxygen requirement.  The patient returned to the\\nfloor in stable condition and was to the Step-Down Cardiac\\nUnit on [**2200-4-8**].

gastrostomy tube found to have bacteremia on blood cultures drawn on 5 15 at dialysis center staph and strep species had been given dose of vanc 5 18 at dialysis echo here with vegetation on mitral valve initiated vanc 5 20 , serial surveillance blood cultures negative afebrile throughout planned course for six weeks , per recommendation of infectious disease team dental extractions performed as presumed source of endocarditis this means that course of vancomycin would be completed on 6 26 plan is 3 weeks of vancomycin prior to initiation of chemo xrt to allow appropriate bacteria clearance in addition to adequate mucosal healing in mouth radiation evaluated him for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma and completed mapping , with plan for first treatment on 6 11 rad onc , med onc , id involved in decision additionally , pt will undergo adjuvant chemo with erbitux , first administered 6 5 at hospital1 18 with subsequent doses to be administered after discharge to hospital1 with coordination with dr first name ( stitle ) name ( stitle ) ( hospital1 18 oncologist ) please have oncology staff at hospital1 contact dr last name ( stitle ) to discuss the likely arrangement is that patient will return to outpatient hospital 478 clinic for infusions for pulmonary infiltrates , received chest ct on 5 23 which demonstrated interval improvement and no clear evidence of septic emboli , and initially received azithromycin for coverage of atypical organisms completed , along with vancomycin , as above on 5 27 pt aspirated after vomiting , and developed a new lll infiltrate consistent with pneumonitis , and required high flow oxygen to maintain oxygen sats in the 90s subsequent to this he was transfered to the icu after spiking a fever and with radiographic evidence of bilateral aspiration pneumonia his antibiotics were expanded to vanc cipro flagyl in the icu , he remained non compliant with therapies , required restraint , and refused hemodialysis he was sent back to the floor the following day ( 5 29 ) as his oxygenation improved ( 90 's on two litres nasal cannula , which he would not keep on , thus requiring restraint ) olanzapine was started for agitation his mental status improved gradually , and by discharge he was no longer noncompliant or agitated , and per family was near baseline pneumonia was felt to be aspiration , and he completed a seven day course of cipro flagyl with radiologic and clinical improvement swallow evaluation 6 5 showed silent aspiration but with counseling and observation he tolerated soft foods and thin liquids he was anxious to expand his diet , but was witnessed to have problems with aspiration when he eats more solid food on 6 6 , the morning after receiving dexamethasone premedication for erbitux , he developed severe hyperglycemia , unresponsive to large doses of sc insulin he was transferred to the icu for management by an insulin drip , and was able to be transferred back to the general medicine unit on 6 8 since that time his sugars have remained in relatively good control , with a bedtime dose of glargine 14 u and insulin by sliding scale he continued to receive dialysis which was well tolerated his diet was advanced to soft solids and even some regular food items ( chicken pot pie , cheeseburger ) , with no observed aspiration on 6 11 he received his first radiation therapy treatment , with plans to return for daily treatments medications on admission patient and hcp unsure of medications but say they are the same as on discharge here in month ( only ) 547 also got dose of vancomycin at

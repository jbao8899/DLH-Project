The extremities were warm, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses\\nbilaterally.  No edema.  Femoral pulses 2+, no bruits.\\nRectal examination was guaiac negative per Emergency\\nDepartment report at the outside hospital.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  From the outside hospital, white count 20.6\\nwith 89 neutrophils, 1 band, 5 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes,\\nhematocrit 38.2, platelets 222, MCV 94.9.  Sodium 138,\\npotassium 4.1, chloride 98, bicarbonate 37, blood urea\\nnitrogen 16, creatinine 0.7, glucose 111.  Prothrombin time\\n12.3, partial thromboplastin time 28.9, INR 1.05.

CKs were cycled.  The patient was held NPO and\\nfamily members were [**Name (NI) 653**].  The patient was continued on\\nLevofloxacin as started at the outside hospital and given\\ninhalers p.r.n.\\n\\nA psychiatry consultation was obtained on the morning of\\n[**2200-4-7**], given the patient's significant degree of\\ndisorientation and confusion and labile emotions.  The\\npsychiatrist's impression was that the patient was suffering\\nfrom delirium with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status\\nexamination with poor memory.  At the time of the interview,\\nthe patient was agreeing to consider catheterization although\\nit was noted that if she changed her mind given the\\nimportance of this procedure that her husband and children\\nshould be [**Doctor Last Name 653**] regarding consent for the procedure and\\nthat her capacity to consent at that time should be held in\\nquestion.  Recommendations were made for Haldol p.r.n. as\\nwell as Xanax.  B12, folate, RPR and TSH were all ordered\\nwhich returned as normal.  The patient also had a head CT at\\nthe outside hospital which was unremarkable.\\n\\nCKs were sent at our hospital with initial level of CPK 464,\\nMB 12 and a troponin of 49 obtained.  The patient had been\\nplaced on Heparin prior to the anticipation of cardiac\\ncatheterization. The patient was initially consented to have\\ncardiac catheterization on [**2200-4-7**], although had an acute\\ndecompensation in mental status and anxiety attack and it was\\ndetermined that she would be at high risk for the procedure\\nat that time.  Thus, the procedure was deferred to the\\nmorning of [**2200-4-8**], and findings were as follows:\\n\\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction 62%.  Inferior\\nhypokinesis.  Normal valves.  Discrete proximal right\\ncoronary artery lesion of 100% stenosis.  Left main 100%\\ndiscrete stenosis.  Mid left anterior descending discrete\\n100% stenosis, 50% discrete midcircumflex stenosis.  Bypass\\ngraft saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was\\n100% discrete stenosis.  Left internal mammary artery to the\\nleft anterior descending patent and RIMA to the right\\ncoronary artery with a 40% stenosis.  No intervention was\\nperformed.\\n\\nIt was determined that the patient should be maximized on\\nmedical therapy only.  The patient was prescribed with\\nAspirin and Plavix at that time and given diuresis for\\nincreasing oxygen requirement.  The patient returned to the\\nfloor in stable condition and was to the Step-Down Cardiac\\nUnit on [**2200-4-8**].  The patient returned to baseline mental\\nstatus throughout the remainder of her hospital stay and was\\ndetermined to be in stable condition by [**2200-4-10**], to be\\ndischarged.  The patient was in agreement with this plan.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.
